Data Science: First Project

Industry: Higher Education 

The first dataset comes from data.gov curated by the Federal Government (the university scorecard). 
The second dataset comes from the Power Elite Database curated by G. William Domhoff (university elites). 
The third dataset comes from the US News and World Reports to provide rankings for the top 220 universities (university rankings). 

These data are merged using the name of the university which matches at the 65 percent level across the three datasets
The university elites data has information on those individuals who are politically connected and the universities where they sit on a board. The idea is that there may be some mechanism by which these elites can influence or shape access to resources and thereby effect the scoreboard ranking.

In order to formulate an idea about how the datasets could be combined for additional value, I use the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test to see whether universities with elites tend to cluster towards higher ranked institutions.
